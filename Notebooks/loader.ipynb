Born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi, Sindh, Jinnah was a barrister by profession and a politician by passion.

His father, Jinnahbhai Poonja, was a merchant, and his mother, Mithibai, was a homemaker. Jinnah was the youngest of seven children, and his family moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) when he was just a year old. He received his early education in Bombay and later moved to London to study law.
